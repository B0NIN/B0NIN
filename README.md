# Hello!

This GitHub account will serve as a snapshot of my programming learning journey 👩🏽‍💻

I work as an <em>English teacher</em> in Japan, but during my free time I work on various personal and work projects.

Below ⬇️ is a badge from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) that tracks my progress through each cirriculum.
